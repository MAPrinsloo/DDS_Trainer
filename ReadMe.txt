//Introduction

The version of the DDS_Trainer app that you have at your disposal is still under
development. The replacing books activity is the only activity functioning as
per the requirements of the PROG7312 POE Part 1 rubric. The gamification
feature implemented is a arcade-style leaderboard that stores its values via
text files. 

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//Installation

If you have not already done so, please unzip the folder that this Readme is

On doing so please open the unzipped folder so that you are back in the

1 - In the file explorer click the path heading and paste this in:
			\DDS_Trainer\bin\Debug
if done correctly you should be in the debug folder.

2 - locate and double click the file that says: 
			retro_computer_personal_use.ttf
3 - Click the Install button located at the top left.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//Running
Follow these steps to run the application:

1 - In the file explorer click the path heading and paste this in:
			\DDS_Trainer\bin\Debug
if done correctly you should be in the debug folder.

2 - locate and double click the file that says: 
			DDS_Trainer.exe
3 - The application should launch and you will be greeted with the Main Menu.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//Main Menu

The main menu will open in full screen, the art style is akin to a retro
computer desktop. The app was developed on a 1920x1080p monitor.

Three app icons will be on the left side
1 - Replacing-Books.exe
2 - Identifying-Areas.exe
3 - Finding-Call-Numbers.exe

Clicking on one of these three icons will open the corresponding activity. 
See the titles relating to these activities for more information.

The leaderboard is shown as a black rectangle window in the bottom right of the 
desktop. The leaderboard shows the top 10 players of the application.

The red power button located in the bottom left among the task bar is used to
exit the app. Please see "Closing the app" to find out more.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//Replacing Books Game

Clicking the icon will open a window onto the "desktop".
Clicking the stop watch will begin the game and start a 2 minute countdown.

You will be presented with randomly generating books with call numbers that 
will be required to be placed in ascending order from left to right. By placing
the last book, the app will check if the books are in the correct order and
allocate the appropriate points. Points can only be accumilated over 2 minutes.

User must drag the books into the correct order, books can be dragged out of 
position if the need to reorder arises.

At the end of the 2 minutes the user will have the stopwatch displayed again, 
users are free to play as many times as they would like.

Clicking the red x at the top right of this "window" will ask the user if they
would like to close this window:

Clicking the blue back button will return them to the main menu desktop.
Clicking the grey no button will cancel the return procedure.

When a high score is achieved a window will appear to congradulate the user and
promts them to enter 3 initials to mark their spot on the leaderboard. Clicking 
the save button will save the initials and close the High score form.

The stopwatch will then be displayed again.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//Closing the app
When clicking The red power button located in the bottom left of the main menu/
desktop:
A window will be displayed on the games "desktop" asking users if they would
like to exit the application.

Clicking the red exit button will close the app.
Clicking the grey no button will cancel the exit procedure.
